# Overview of your first REST API

import VideoEmbed from "@site/src/components/VideoEmbed";

<div style={{ maxWidth: "720px", margin: "3rem auto", boxShadow: "0 5px 15px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)" }}>
<VideoEmbed url="https://customer-zmitazl0ztnd2pvm.cloudflarestream.com/cda9c0473bdc485a36905144f13f4d3f/iframe?poster=https%3A%2F%2Fcustomer-zmitazl0ztnd2pvm.cloudflarestream.com%2Fcda9c0473bdc485a36905144f13f4d3f%2Fthumbnails%2Fthumbnail.jpg%3Ftime%3D%26height%3D600" />
</div>

In this section we'll make a simple REST API that allows us to:

- Create stores, each with a `name` and a list of stocked `items`.
- Create an item within a store, each with a `name` and a `price`.
- Retrieve a list of all stores and their items.
- Given its `name`, retrieve an individual store and all its items.
- Given a store `name`, retrieve only a list of item within it.

This is how the interaction will go!
