# REST API using Flask-Smorest and Docker

This is a REST API that mimics an online store, with users, stores, items, and item tags.

How to code this REST API is covered in our [REST APIs with Flask and Python](https://github.com/tecladocode/rest-apis-flask-python) course.

You can access the Swagger documentation (automatically generated from source) here:

[https://rest-api-smorest-docker.onrender.com/swagger-ui](https://rest-api-smorest-docker.onrender.com/swagger-ui)

To interact with the API, you can download the `Flask-JWT-Extended.postman_collection.json` (Postman) or `Stores_REST_API_2022-01-14.json` (Insomnia REST Client) files. Then set the URL to `https://rest-api-smorest-docker.onrender.com` and you can run the requests.
